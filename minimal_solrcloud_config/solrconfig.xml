    <!-- Enables a transaction log, used for real-time get, durability, and
         and solr cloud replica recovery.  The log can grow as big as
         uncommitted changes to the index, so use of a hard autoCommit
         is recommended (see below).
         "dir" - the target directory for transaction logs, defaults to the
                solr data directory.
         "numVersionBuckets" - sets the number of buckets used to keep
                track of max version values when checking for re-ordered
                updates; increase this value to reduce the cost of
                synchronizing access to version buckets during high-volume
                indexing, this requires 8 bytes (long) * numVersionBuckets
                of heap space per Solr core.

    <!-- AutoCommit

         Perform a hard commit automatically under certain conditions.
         Instead of enabling autoCommit, consider using "commitWithin"
         when adding documents. 

         http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages

         maxDocs - Maximum number of documents to add since the last
                   commit before automatically triggering a new commit.

         maxTime - Maximum amount of time in ms that is allowed to pass
                   since a document was added before automatically
                   triggering a new commit. 
         openSearcher - if false, the commit causes recent index changes
           to be flushed to stable storage, but does not cause a new
           searcher to be opened to make those changes visible.

         If the updateLog is enabled, then it's highly recommended to
         have some sort of hard autoCommit to limit the log size.

    <autoCommit>
      <maxTime>${solr.autoCommit.maxTime:15000}</maxTime>
      <openSearcher>false</openSearcher>
    </autoCommit>

    <!-- softAutoCommit is like autoCommit except it causes a
         'soft' commit which only ensures that changes are visible
         but does not ensure that data is synced to disk.  This is
         faster and more near-realtime friendly than a hard commit.
